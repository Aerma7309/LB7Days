problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

Approach 1: 

    1: find profit that can be achieved if stock is being sold on i-th day
    2: update cost price if today's price is less than it
    3: update max profit if profit is greater than it
    
    Time complexity: O(N), Where N is the size of the array.
    Space complexity: O(1)


Approach 2: Brute Force
    
    1: buy on each day and try selling it in future days
    2: keep track of maximum profit earned

    Time complexity: O(N^2), Where N is the size of the array.
    Space complexity: O(1)
